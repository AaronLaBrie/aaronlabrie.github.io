        I more or less just followed the <i>It's Alive</i> take on this, let it
        ride for a year, and it turned out tasty! If you wanna make your own or
        find yummy stuff to use it in, check your local Asian grocery, such as
        <a href="https://asahiimports.com/" target="_blank">Asahi</a> up on
        Burnet. Also check out the great cookbook

        This is a one-year-old 'red' miso. Same ingredients as the 'white' miso
        you might have seen before, you just let it ferment longer. It's
        technically still fermenting which is neat! It doesn't really need to be
        refrigerated but you can if you'd like. If anything icky grows on the
        top just scrape it off. If it gives off any liquid that's just tamari
        (gluten-free soy sauce!) and you can either mix it back up or use it
        separately.

        >
        a classic miso soup recipe to get started. The dashi can be
        store-bought, and you can make/buy it vegetarian as well. You may want
        to toss some miso into a food processor before making this - I think
        that's better for making soups or anything that you want it to fully
        dissolve in.
