        I more or less just followed the "It's Alive" take on this, let it ride
        for a year, and it turned out great! If you wanna make your own or find
        yummy stuff to use it in, check your local Asian grocery. I like
        <a href="https://asahiimports.com/" target="_blank">Asahi</a> up on
        Burnet.

        This is a one-year-old 'red' miso. Same ingredients as the 'white' miso
        you might have seen before, you just let it ferment longer. It doesn't
        really need to be refrigerated but you can if you'd like. It's
        technically still fermenting which is neat! If anything icky grows on
        the top just scrape it off. If it gives off any liquid that's just
        tamari (gluten-free soy sauce!) and you can either mix it back up or use
        it separately. If you prefer a finer texture you can just toss it in a
        food processor, totally your call.

        I've done some recipes (and stolen the website colors from) Bonnie
        Chung's great cookbook

        and can safely recommend it. Here's her recipe for a very basic miso
        soup, just like what you get to start your meal at any Japanese
        restaurant. She likes to use both red and white miso, so if you'd like
        to follow the recipe exactly go pick up some white miso.
